            The wife and son of a Mexican drug lord embark on a vengeful quest to kill all those involved in his trial and imprisonment -- 
            including Miami Detective Mike Lowrey. When Mike gets wounded, he teams up with partner Marcus Burnett and AMMO -- a special tactical squad -- 
            to bring the culprits to justice. But the old-school, wisecracking cops must soon learn to get along with their new elite counterparts 
            if they are to take down the vicious cartel that threatens their lives.</p>
