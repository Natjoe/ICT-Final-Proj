            <p>
            After he and his wife are murdered, marine Ray Garrison is resurrected<br> 
            by a team of scientists. Enhanced with nanotechnology, he becomes a superhuman, <br>
            biotech killing machine - Bloodshot. As Ray first trains with fellow super-soldiers,<br>
             he cannot recall anything from his former life. But when his memories flood back and<br>
              he remembers the man that killed both him and his wife, he breaks out of the facility<br>
               to get revenge, only to discover that there's more to the conspiracy than he thought.
