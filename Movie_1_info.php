            <h1><u>Synopsis</u></h1>
            <p>
            The wife and son of a Mexican drug lord embark on a vengeful quest to kill <br>
            all those involved in his trial and imprisonment -- including Miami Detective Mike Lowrey.<br>
             When Mike gets wounded, he teams up with partner Marcus Burnett and AMMO -- a special <br>
             tactical squad -- to bring the culprits to justice. But the old-school, wisecracking cops<br>
             must soon learn to get along with their new elite counterparts if they are to take down the <br>
             vicious cartel that threatens their lives.
