            <p>
            The world needed a hero -- it got a hedgehog. Powered with incredible speed,
             Sonic embraces his new home on Earth --<br> until he accidentally knocks out the 
             power grid, sparking the attention of uncool evil genius Dr. Robotnik. Now, 
             it's supervillain vs.<br> supersonic in an all-out race across the globe to stop 
             Robotnik from using Sonic's unique power to achieve world domination.
