            <h1><u>Synopsis</u></h1>
            <p>
            Dr. John Dolittle lives in solitude behind the high walls of his lush manor<br>
            in 19th-century England. His only companionship comes from an array of exotic <br>
            animals that he speaks to on a daily basis. But when young Queen Victoria becomes<br>
            gravely ill, the eccentric doctor and his furry friends embark on an epic adventure<br>
            to a mythical island to find the cure.
